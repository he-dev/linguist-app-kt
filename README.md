# Language Files

Each language folder contains two sets of `*.yaml` files:

- `vocabulary-*.yaml`
- `grammar-*.yaml`

Files in each set can have one of three suffixes:

- `practice` - Stuff I want to learn. Use at least 1 word per sentence, more when natural.

- `reuse` - Stuff I am comfortable with. Use to build natural, meaningful sentences around `practice` vocabulary.

- `avoid` - Stuff I have seen too many times any starts to be annoying. Try to never use these words in exercises.

Additionaly the `vocabulary-practice.yaml` file can contain auxiliary hints.

- `hi` - stands for high-priority (e.g., `- alegre: hi`). These items should appear much more frequently across exercise sets.


# Exercises

- Absurdity welcome = unusual scenarios, weird combinations, ridiculous contexts
- BUT the cause-effect, relationships, and internal logic must still make sense
- Don't just throw random vocabulary together without coherent meaning creating random word salad.
- At least one I, you, he/she, we, they sentence.
- Score results in percentage on word-by-word basis.
