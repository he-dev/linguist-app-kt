# Vocabulary Files

Each `xx_vocabulary.yaml` file uses the following properties for their entries:

- `new` - Stuff I want to learn. Use at least one such entry per exercise, more when natural.
- `hi` - Stuff I have difficulties to learn. Try to use these entries much more frequently because they have a higher priority than `new`. They can also replace `new`. So it is an either-or if in doubt.
- `lo` - Stuff I have seen too many times and starts to be annoying. Try to avoid using these entries.
- nothing - Stuff I am comfortable with. Use these entries to build natural, meaningful sentences around `new` or `hi` vocabulary.


# Exercises

Exercises, if possible, should follow these rules:

- Absurdity welcome = unusual scenarios, weird combinations, ridiculous contexts.
- However, the cause-effect, relationships, and internal logic must still make sense.
- Don't just throw random vocabulary together without coherent meaning creating random word salad.
- At least one I, you, he/she, we, they sentence.
- Maximize vocabulary variety - avoid repeating the same practice words across multiple sets. 
- Track which practice words I've used recently and actively avoid repeating them. 
- Score results in percentage on word-by-word basis.

New exercise types to add:
1. Preposition Drill

Sentence fragments with blanks for a/en/de/al/del/etc.
Focus on your consistent trouble spots
Quick, targeted practice

2. Ser vs Estar Gauntlet

Every sentence forces a ser/estar choice
Tests your "fluctuation framework" understanding
Great for solidifying that tricky distinction

5. Backward Translation (Spanish → English)

Tests comprehension and recognition
Different skill than production
Good variety from always translating English → Spanish

6. Error Correction

I write sentences with YOUR typical errors
You identify and fix them
